Mediation analysis code was adapted from Bommae K. 2016. "Introduction to Mediation Analysis." UVA Library StatLab. https://library.virginia.edu/data/articles/introduction-to-mediation-analysis (accessed November 1, 2023). Stack overflow and ChatGPT were consulted when troubleshooting code for the analyses. <br />
